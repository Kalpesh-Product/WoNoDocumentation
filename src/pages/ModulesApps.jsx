            into <span className="font-semibold">Modules</span> and{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">Apps</span>. These services are
            designed to help client companies streamline operations, enhance
            productivity, and ensure smooth management of both departmental and
            organizational activities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            <span className="font-semibold">Modules</span> represent
            department-specific management systems tailored to meet the unique
            needs of each business function. For example, the{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">Finance Module</span> provides tools
            for income and expense tracking, budgeting, and financial reporting.
            The <span className="font-semibold">Sales Module</span> enables lead
            management, tracking of sources, and conversion analytics. The{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">HR Module</span> supports payroll
            processing, employee management, and attendance tracking. Each
            module is built to optimize departmental workflows while maintaining
            integration with the larger organizational ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            <span className="font-semibold">Apps</span> are specialized
            solutions that extend beyond departmental operations and focus on
            core organizational activities. For instance, the{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">Meeting Management App</span> helps
            companies schedule and manage meetings, allocate meeting rooms, and
            streamline collaboration. The{" "}

            provides a complete helpdesk system for handling internal and
            external service requests efficiently. Similarly, the{" "}

          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
